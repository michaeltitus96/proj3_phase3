Starting coordinates = [1,1,45]
Ending coordinates = [9,9]
RPM Values = [10,20] (or you can use [15,30])
Clearance = anything between 0.2 and 0.4

The time of each action state is 0.5 seconds.

The value action_sequence (which is printed onto termianl at end) is the order of actions (e.g. If the first action state is [10,10], both wheels move at a speed of 10 RPM for 0.5 seconds. If the next state is [0,20], the left wheel stops moving and the right wheels moves at 20 RPM for 0.5 seconds)
